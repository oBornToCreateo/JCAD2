# JCAD2
I want to create simple CAD software in 1 year

My assumptions :
- Creation of sketches (line, arc, circle, cutting, closing, snapping, maybe ellipse and spline);
- Extrusion of created sketch;

Additionally 
- finding intersections in 3D (BOOL operations);
- finding arc length;
- finding moments of inertia/mass by density of solids;
- Creation of parametric curves/surfaces;
