# JCAD2

I want to create 'simple' CAD software in 1 year

My assumptions :

- Creation of sketches:
  - Polyline, 
  - Arc, 
  - Circle,
  - (additionally) Ellipse,
  - (additionally) Spline,

- Connection nodes:
  - Snapping,
  - Tangtency,
  - Collinearity,
  - Parallelism, 
  - Perpendicularity,
  - Concentricity,

- Functions:
  - Cutting (2d intersection),
  - (additionally) Extrusion in 3D of created sketches,
  - (additionally) Finding intersections in 3d (BOOL operations),
  - (additionally) Finding arc length,
  - (additionally) Finding moments of inertia/mass by density of solids,
  - (additionally) Creation of parametric curves/surfaces,
